# From-Ecology-to-Robotics-and-Back-Mutualisms-as-a-Framework-for-Multi-Robot-Collaboration

First, please install the robotarium-matlab-simulator from https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator. The repository contains detailed instructions on how to get started.

Once installed, you should be able to run all of the "ecobotic_..." scripts successfully, meaning that these scripts can be uploaded to https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/ such that experimental videos are acquired (Figure 1). Each of these scripts will output task fecundity, longevity, and robot fitness data as a function of the experimental parameters chosen (Table 1). Such data is then saved to "case_study_experiment_data.mat", which generates the task fecundity, longevity, and robot fitness plots where the landscape composition varies between high-variability and low-variability (Figure 2). Note that the landscape composition varies discretely -- and not over a continuum.
